# Lasso-regression-and-Logistic-Regression
Brief analysis of Lasso and Logistic regression based on the dimensions of the features.

Used a music dataset MARSYAS, http://marsyas.info/index.html. Among the 10 genres, we used only four genres ( classical, jazz, pop,and rock) in this problem. Each genre has the 100 music files and each music file was preprocessed into 1200 frame samples. (folder data : 320:train, 40:val, 40:test). The frames were averaged over a window size(20,40,60,80,120). The main objective of this project was to analyse the performance of the two algorithms according to the window size.
